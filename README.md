# Py-Project1-SWG-Game
A simple Snake, Water, Gun game implemented in Python. The user plays against the computer, choosing one of the three options (Snake, Water, or Gun). The game follows the classic rules where each option beats one and loses to the other. A fun way to practice basic Python concepts like conditionals and random choice.
